**Customer company:** Innovatech

**Description of the task:**
Innovatech is a cutting-edge technology company specializing in developing and selling advanced gadgets and devices. Our latest product, Innovatech VR Pro, offers state-of-the-art virtual reality experiences. This project involves creating an online platform to introduce and pre-order the new Innovatech VR Pro. The application includes a product page, an order form, a news feed, and contact information. The platform should be responsive to different devices and deployed on GitHub Pages.

**Additional requirements:**
- Product Page: Display the main characteristics and features of Innovatech VR Pro, including photos, videos, and product descriptions.
- Order Form: Form for pre-ordering the VR headset, requesting the user's name, email address, and desired number of devices. Validate data on the client side.
- News Feed: Section with the latest news about Innovatech VR Pro - release dates, updates, and other important events.
- Contact Information: Section with company contact information for communicating with potential clients.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the web application displays correctly on different devices.
- Technology Selection: Use React.js for developing the application.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages: The application must be deployed to GitHub Pages to showcase the work.

**Restrictions:**
- Must be implemented using React.js.
- The application must be responsive and work well on different devices.
- Ensure client-side validation for the order form.

**Answers to possible questions:**
- **What if I encounter issues with GitHub Pages deployment?**
  - Make sure the `homepage` field in `package.json` is set correctly and that you've installed the `gh-pages` package.
- **How do I handle form validation?**
  - Use simple client-side validation in the `OrderForm` component using React state and conditional rendering for error messages.
